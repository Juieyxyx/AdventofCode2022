My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. (Original source: https://adventofcode.com/2022)


As a beginner in Java and a big fan of Christmas, I'm fascinated by Advent of Code because I can hone my coding skills and prepare for Christmas in this season of Advent. It's real fun to combine these two amazing things together!  

Happy coding and happy holidays to everyone! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
